This CRUD application helps manage records with a simple and easy-to-use interface. On the front end, it uses React.js to create a user-friendly design where you can add, view, edit, and delete records. The backend is built with Node.js and Express.js, which handles the requests from the front end and processes the data. For storing and managing the records, it uses a MySQL database. This project shows how to build a complete web application, combining a responsive front end with a backend service and a database.
